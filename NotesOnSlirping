It was needed for me to edit the Makefile before running the "make" command to create the bhjet.sl file. 
1. I had to check the compilers used in CC/CXX/FC
2. add -I/opt/local/include to SLANGINC	
3. add `pkg-config --cflags gsl` in CC_COMPILE/CXX_COMPILE/FC_COMPILE

This could solve issues such as "gsl/gsl_*.h not found" 

Then I was getting an error of symbols not recognized, but it was because Bknpower.o was missing from OBJ and from slirpAgnjet command, which has to be edited to:
 rm Makefile; slirp -ldflags "bhjet.o utils.o jetpars.o BBody.o Cyclosyn.o Mixed.o Particles.o ShSDisk.o Compton.o Kappa.o Powerlaw.o Radiation.o Thermal.o Bkpower.o" -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm  bhjet.hh



In my new computer I cannot solve the segmentation fault happening when I run the "make test". This is the message:

$> make test
slsh -n bhjet-test.sl
Namespace "Global" already exists
Namespace "Global" already exists
make: *** [test] Segmentation fault: 11
